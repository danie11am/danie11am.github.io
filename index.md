Greetings! I'm Daniel Lam, a software engineer currently focused on iOS. 

I developed the [Jamophone app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id535422655) and work for clients on iOS projects. If you need an iOS developer, please reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danie11am).

Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, running and spending time with my family.
