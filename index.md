Greetings! I'm Daniel Lam, a software engineer currently focused on iOS. 

I published the [Jamophone app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id535422655) and work for clients on iOS projects. I enjoy the creation process through coding.

Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, running and spending time with my family.
